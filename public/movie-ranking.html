<h1>The Best Movies According To Yitzchak</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time:</h2>
<hr />
 <h3>Thor ragnarok</h3>
<p>This is a very good sci-fi movie by Marvel studios</p> 

 <h3>Bourne-Identity </h3>
 <p>This was a brilliantly done espionage movie, I enjoyed it.</p>

 <h3>The Equalizer</h3>
 <p>The best movie I've watched so far, purely because of how one man is able<br /> to take down all the bad guys with his skills.</p>
